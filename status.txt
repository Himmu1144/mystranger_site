This is the ultimate template for omegle_text 
In this template the connection and diconnection have been handled very efficiently 
and beside that nothing else has been updated so that from here any changes can be made into it , to make it fit according to one's own needs.

so when we added the skip system here , we got some inconsistencies while connecting the two strangers and later we found out that this can be because of the channel layers , that we have to user seperate channel layers for the users.

This code contains that bug discussed above.
and with cleaned code.

here we are using channels==4.0.0 instead of channels==3.0.5

the skip bug has been resolved but here stil are issues with the skip , we have to fix that shit as soon as possible.

In short this is the perfect text code. The code that works and hence someone said , if it works then don't touch it

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

video feature is now working fine , though whether it is scalable or not , that is still a question 
but as of now the video feature is working smoothly.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first part of nearby feature which is gathering the exact location at the time of registration is now approximately complete and from now on 
the focus has to be on the second part.

The Second Part of connecting users on the basis of nearby and origin has also been done 
Though there are some defects left like - 

.edu.in - only works for .edu.in universitites while registration | Done - Now you can register with either .edu or .edu.in or .ac.in

count is generic not specific
The final update from the backend for patient zero is not present
origin and nearby does not work entirely , they are specific not generic

beside these defects everything is working fine, the only thing left is the friend system
The Friend System is now complete, therefore now only the notification system is what's left and then the site is complete.
