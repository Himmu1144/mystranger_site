This is the ultimate template for omegle_text 
In this template the connection and diconnection have been handled very efficiently 
and beside that nothing else has been updated so that from here any changes can be made into it , to make it fit according to one's own needs.

so when we added the skip system here , we got some inconsistencies while connecting the two strangers and later we found out that this can be because of the channel layers , that we have to user seperate channel layers for the users.

This code contains that bug discussed above.
and with cleaned code.

here we are using channels==4.0.0 instead of channels==3.0.5

the skip bug has been resolved but here stil are issues with the skip , we have to fix that shit as soon as possible.

In short this is the perfect text code. The code that works and hence someone said , if it works then don't touch it
